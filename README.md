# DECI Adventure Game Final Project
This repository contains the source code and documentation for a text-based adventure game developed as part of the Digital Egypt Cubs Initiative (DECI) Program Level 2. Created using Python, the game showcases proficiency in programming concepts such as loops, functions, if conditions, lists, tuples, dictionaries, and more. Additionally, it demonstrates the developer's skills in time management and efficient problem-solving. The project offers valuable practical experience and an opportunity to apply and expand programming skills.

## Overview

This project is a simple text-based adventure game where players navigate through various scenarios by making choices. The game provides a description of each scenario and prompts the player to make a choice, with different outcomes depending on the choice made. It includes conditions for winning and losing, allowing players to play again after the game is over. Additionally, the game incorporates random factors to add variability and replayability.

## Features

- Description of Scenarios: Each scenario is accompanied by a descriptive text to set the scene for the player's choices.
- Player Choice: Players are prompted to make decisions at different points in the game, with consequences based on their choices.
- Win/Loss Conditions: The game includes conditions for winning and losing, providing feedback to the player based on their actions.
- Replayability: Players can play the game multiple times, with the option to restart after the game ends.
- Randomization: Random elements are integrated into the game to introduce variability and unpredictability, ensuring a unique experience with each playthrough.

## Project Structure

- **main.py**: Contains the main logic of the game, including scenario descriptions, player choices, win/loss conditions, and replay functionality.
- **functions.py**: Utilizes functions to modularize the code and improve readability and maintainability.
- **randomization.py**: Includes randomization functions or modules to introduce randomness into the game.
- **assets/**: Directory for storing any additional resources or assets used in the game.
- **README.md**: Provides an overview of the project, its features, and structure.

## Usage

1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Run `python main.py` to start the game.
3. Follow the prompts to navigate through the scenarios and make choices.
4. Enjoy the adventure and see if you can win!

## Future Improvements

- Add more scenarios and choices to expand the game world.
- Enhance the user interface with graphics or animations.
